The standard function `hack-dir-local-variables' stops looking for
`dir-locals-file' after the first one found in the current directory
tree, ignoring ones in parent directories. This function adds an
enhancement such that all `dir-locals-file' files are loaded in their
order in the directory tree, i.e., from top to bottom, enabling all to
be loaded without redefinition in subdirectories.

Note that this behavior is slightly different from that of hook
functions in `hack-dir-local-get-variables-functions'. See the
`hack-dir-local-variables' code for the difference in variable loading
behavior.

Use this function as an around advice for `hack-dir-local-variables',
which FUN refers to."

stopping at the first `dir-locals-file' found. It walks up the directory tree to
find all of them, merging variables based on their proximity of definitions to
the location of the current file, i.e., closely defined variables take
precedence. For the merging logic, see `hack-dir-local-variables' code.

Add this hook function to `hack-dir-local-get-variables-functions', in place or
in addition to `hack-dir-local--get-variables'. See the documentation of
`hack-dir-local-get-variables-functions' for detail on its return value.
